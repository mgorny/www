  Mentoring two students with Portage_-related projects.  One of them
  is writing a FUSE_-based Gentoo sandbox_ replacement, a tool
  to restrict build process' access to the filesystem, for GSoC_ 2020.
  The other one is implementing a new binary package format as described
  in `GLEP 78`_, as a university project.

name: Split distfile mirror directory structure
date: 2019-10-03
tags: infra python spec
desc: |
  A project for moving distribution files on Gentoo mirrors from
  a single flat directory to a more efficient tree of subdirectories.
  Covers the specification (`GLEP 75`_), Portage_ implementation
  and infra tasks regarding the transition.  The key concept is using
  a hash of filename to split files into even buckets while preserving
  the ability to identify the correct bucket from filename.

  In response to `key poisoning attacks on SKS`_, I have disabled key
  exchange with SKS network and established a new secure pipeline
  to upload keys to Gentoo keyserver.  This permitted Gentoo to continue
  operating under the web-of-trust model while remaining resilient
  to the attacks.

desc: |
  Support of containerizing package builds in Portage_ via use of Linux
  kernel namespaces.  Initially it was used to prevent built programs
  from unexpectedly accessing the Internet and local network services.
  Afterwards, it was extended to cover isolation of mounts, processes
  (with reliable killing of leftovers) and predictable hostname setting.

name: python-r1 eclass suite

tags: bash gentoo package-management
gitgo: repo/gentoo.git
desc: |
  A new eclass suite to build and install Python packages.  Combined
  good ideas from other eclasses with a few innovations.  The latter
  include separate eclasses for different purposes (build-time dep,
  single-impl and multi-impl install) and variables for explicit
  metadata building with generator functions for more complex needs.
  So far this remains the state-of-the-art example for eclass API.

  Created the framework for building kernels via packages, and added
  initial Distribution Kernel packages.  This provides an alternative
  to the historical way of packaging kernel sources and building them
  manually, and aligns Gentoo with other distributions (including its
  derivatives).  DK provides the ability to build from source or use
  a prebuilt binary package, to use generic or user-supplied
  configuration.  It features initramfs support (via Dracut_)
  and a binary-package friendly support for different install layouts
  via pluggable ``installkernel`` script.

  A Python package providing an objective wrapper API to the three

  by the package managers themselves.  Nowadays effectively defunct
  as Paludis is no longer developed, and PkgCore is much faster than
  Portage while remaining reasonably compatible, rendering fallback
